🔧 STREAMING FIX APPLIED

The "Failed to send message" error has been fixed!

WHAT WAS WRONG:
  - NestJS @Sse decorator doesn't work well with POST
  - Observable pattern was causing issues

WHAT WAS FIXED:
  ✓ Changed to manual SSE implementation
  ✓ Using Express Response directly
  ✓ Callback pattern instead of Observable
  ✓ Same functionality, better compatibility

HOW TO TEST:
  1. Restart backend: cd backend && npm run start:dev
  2. Refresh frontend
  3. Open any conversation
  4. Send a message
  5. Should stream properly now! ✨

The streaming endpoint is now fully functional!
