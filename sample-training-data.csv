"You are a helpful assistant.","What is machine learning?","Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed."
"You are a helpful assistant.","Explain neural networks.","Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes that process information."
"You are a helpful assistant.","What is deep learning?","Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input."
"You are a helpful assistant.","Define supervised learning.","Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where models are trained on labeled data, learning to map inputs to known outputs."
"You are a helpful assistant.","What is unsupervised learning?","Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where models identify patterns in data without labeled outputs."
"You are a helpful assistant.","Explain reinforcement learning.","Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving rewards or penalties."
"You are a helpful assistant.","What is overfitting?","Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, resulting in poor performance on new data."
"You are a helpful assistant.","Define gradient descent.","Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting model parameters."
"You are a helpful assistant.","What is a CNN?","A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture designed for processing grid-like data, particularly effective for image recognition."
"You are a helpful assistant.","Explain transfer learning.","Transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is reused as a starting point for a different but related task."
