## ❓ FAQ

### Q: How long will this take?
**A**: Depends on scope:
- Quick Wins: 1 day
- Revenue Analytics: 2-3 days
- Configuration System: 5-7 days
- MVP Package: 2-3 weeks
- Complete Platform: 8 weeks

### Q: What's the recommended approach?
**A**: Start with **Quick Wins** (1 day), then **Revenue Analytics** (3 days), then proceed with **Configuration System** and other critical features.

### Q: Can I build incrementally?
**A**: Yes! That's the recommended approach. Each feature is independent and can be built separately.

### Q: What's the priority order?
**A**: 
1. 🔴 Revenue Analytics (business critical)
2. 🔴 GDPR Compliance (legal risk)
3. 🔴 Configuration System (operational flexibility)
4. 🔴 Customer Health Scoring (prevent churn)
5. 🟡 Everything else

### Q: Do I need to change existing code?
**A**: Minimal changes. Most features are additive (new services, controllers, pages).

### Q: Will this scale?
**A**: Yes. Uses caching, background jobs, and proper indexes for performance.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start Small, Scale Fast
Don't try to build everything at once. Start with Quick Wins, then add features based on actual needs.

### 2. Cache Everything
Use Redis to cache settings, metrics, and computed values. 5-minute TTL for most things.

### 3. Background Jobs
Use Bull/BullMQ for expensive calculations (churn prediction, report generation, email sends).

### 4. Monitor Performance
Add monitoring for slow queries, API response times, and cache hit rates.

### 5. Test with Real Data
Don't just test with mock data. Use production-like datasets to catch edge cases.
