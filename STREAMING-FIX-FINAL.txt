✅ FOUND THE BUG!

The streaming service was using:
  Ollama (basic LLM)
  
Instead of:
  ChatOllama (chat model)

Ollama doesn't handle message objects properly for streaming!
It was converting SystemMessage/HumanMessage to "[object Object]"

FIXED:
  Changed to ChatOllama which properly handles chat messages

RESTART BACKEND AND TEST:
  cd backend && npm run start:dev
  
This should completely fix the "JavaScript objects" issue!
