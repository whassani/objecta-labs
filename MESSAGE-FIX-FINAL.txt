✅ CHAT MESSAGE BUG FIXED!

ISSUE:
  AI was responding with:
  "It appears you've provided a list of JavaScript objects..."

ROOT CAUSE:
  The streaming code was querying conversation history AFTER 
  saving the user message, so historyMessages already contained
  the current message. Then we were adding it again, causing
  a duplicate that confused the LLM.

FIX APPLIED:
  Removed the duplicate message addition. Now the code correctly
  uses the historyMessages which already includes the current
  user message.

HOW TO TEST:
  1. Restart backend: cd backend && npm run start:dev
  2. Refresh browser
  3. Send message: "Hello"
  4. Should get proper response! ✅

EXPECTED:
  User: "Hello"
  AI: "Hello! How can I help you today?"

The bug is now fixed!
