- You want to scale fast

### Should You Go Full-Time Now?

**Go full-time if**:
- You have 6-12 months runway
- Co-founder(s) are committed
- Strong customer validation
- Can't build while working

**Stay part-time if**:
- Still validating idea
- Need to build MVP first
- Financial constraints
- Can make progress nights/weekends

3. **Solution**: Why is your solution better than alternatives?
